# Gurren-Core
A base library for my BTD6 mods. Contains code that the projects share. Built for consistency and reliability. 

## Why does this exist?
When BTD6 modding first exploded, an api was created to make BTD6 modding a lot easier. That api was called [NKHook6](https://github.com/TDToolbox/NKHook6). It was slated to be a Swiss army knife of tools for BTD6 modding. Unfortunately there was a lot of dispute about the direction of the project and it went through several massive overhauls that broke nearly everything. It got so bad the project got archived so it could go through yet another overhaul. With all the uncertainty and unreliability of the project, I decided to make my own api for BTD6 mods. Anyone is free to use this with their mods, however it's mainly being created for my personal mods. This api will be stable and it's purpose is to provide useful and tested code for your BTD6 mods

## Credits
A lot of the code in this project was taken from the depreciated version of NKHook6. While I worked on a decent amount of that code, not all of it is mine or was worked on by me. Therefore all credit for code not worked on by me goes to the original creators.
