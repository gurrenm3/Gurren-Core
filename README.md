# Gurren-Core
A lightweight and reliable api for BTD6. Giving you peace of mind that your mods won't break every time there's an update. Mainly used as a base library for all of my BTD6 mods

## Why does this exist?
The previous C# api for BTD6([NKHook6](https://github.com/TDToolbox/NKHook6)) was slated to be the Swiss army knife of tools for BTD6 modding. While it sounded good on paper there was unfortunately a lot of dispute about the direction of the project. It went through many major overhauls and frequently broke all of the mods that used it. I got tired of remaking everything so I've made this api as a stable platform for mods to build off of. It preserves some of the code that was in the old version of NKHook6 and adds a lot of new code as well. Gurren Core is not intended to take the place of any existing BTD6 api, instead it's aim is to provide a reliable backend that you can trust. It won't have frequent overhauls and it won't break your mods. I'm mainly planning on using this with my own personal mods however anyone is free to use this

## Credits
A lot of the code in this project was taken from the depreciated version of [NKHook6](https://github.com/TDToolbox/NKHook6). While I worked on a decent amount of this code, not all of it is mine or was worked on by me. Therefore all credit for code not worked on by me goes to the original creators. As of right now thats just Mallis the other creator of NKHook6.
